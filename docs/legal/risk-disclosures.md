# Risk Disclosures

**IMPORTANT: PLEASE READ THESE RISK DISCLOSURES CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE EAGLE OMNICHAIN VAULT PROTOCOL. THESE DISCLOSURES CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT RISKS THAT COULD RESULT IN PARTIAL OR TOTAL LOSS OF YOUR DIGITAL ASSETS.**

*Effective Date: October 1, 2025*

## Overview

The Eagle Omnichain Vault Protocol ("Eagle Protocol") involves significant risks that users must understand before participating. Digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are experimental, highly volatile, and subject to numerous risks that could result in substantial losses.

**NO INVESTMENT ADVICE**: This document does not constitute investment, financial, legal, or tax advice. Consult qualified professionals before making any investment decisions.

## 1. Smart Contract and Technology Risks

### Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
- **Code Exploits**: Smart contracts may contain bugs, vulnerabilities, or exploits that could result in loss of funds
- **Upgrade Risks**: Protocol upgrades may introduce new vulnerabilities or change functionality unexpectedly
- **Composability Risks**: Integration with third-party protocols (Charm Finance, LayerZero) creates additional attack surfaces
- **Governance Attacks**: Malicious governance proposals could compromise protocol security

### Technical Infrastructure Risks
- **Network Congestion**: Blockchain networks may experience congestion leading to failed transactions or high fees
- **Oracle Failures**: Price feeds and data oracles may provide incorrect information affecting protocol operations
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Risks**: Asset transfers between blockchains involve bridge protocols that may fail or be exploited
- **Key Management**: Loss of private keys results in permanent loss of access to funds

## 2. Market and Financial Risks

### Asset Volatility
- **Price Volatility**: Digital asset prices are extremely volatile and can result in significant losses
- **Correlation Risk**: Assets may become highly correlated during market stress, reducing diversification benefits
- **Liquidity Risk**: Markets may become illiquid, making it difficult to exit positions at favorable prices
- **Slippage**: Large transactions may experience significant price slippage affecting returns

### Impermanent Loss
- **Liquidity Provision Risks**: Providing liquidity to automated market makers can result in impermanent loss
- **Rebalancing Costs**: Frequent rebalancing may incur transaction costs that reduce overall returns
- **Strategy Performance**: Automated strategies may underperform simple holding strategies
- **Fee Drag**: Protocol fees and transaction costs may significantly impact net returns

## 3. Regulatory and Compliance Risks

### Regulatory Uncertainty
- **Changing Regulations**: New laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit DeFi activities
- **Compliance Requirements**: Users may be required to comply with additional regulations
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Services may become unavailable in certain jurisdictions
- **Tax Implications**: Tax treatment of DeFi activities may change and create unexpected liabilities

### Legal Risks
- **Regulatory Action**: Regulators may take action against the protocol or participants
- **Legal Status**: The legal status of digital assets and DeFi protocols remains uncertain
- **Enforcement Actions**: Regulatory enforcement may result in service interruptions or asset freezing
- **Court Proceedings**: Legal disputes may affect protocol operations or asset recovery

## 4. Operational and Business Risks

### Protocol Operations
- **Team Risk**: The protocol development team may be unavailable or unable to maintain operations
- **Funding Risk**: Insufficient funding may impact protocol development and maintenance
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Reliance on third-party services creates operational risks
- **Centralization Risks**: Certain protocol functions may be more centralized than expected

### Governance Risks
- **Governance Attacks**: Malicious actors may attempt to control protocol governance
- **Voter Apathy**: Low participation in governance may enable harmful proposals
- **Conflicting Interests**: Stakeholders may have conflicting interests affecting decisions
- **Implementation Delays**: Governance decisions may be slow to implement or may not be implemented

## 5. Cross-Chain and Integration Risks

### LayerZero Integration Risks
- **Cross-Chain Message Failure**: Messages between chains may fail or be delayed
- **Relayer Risks**: Cross-chain operations rely on third-party relayers that may be unreliable
- **Endpoint Failures**: LayerZero endpoints may experience outages or failures
- **Configuration Errors**: Incorrect cross-chain configurations may result in lost funds

### Charm Finance Alpha Vault Risks
- **Strategy Performance**: Charm Finance strategies may underperform or result in losses
- **Integration Failures**: Technical integration issues may affect vault operations
- **Third-Party Changes**: Changes to Charm Finance protocols may impact Eagle Protocol functionality
- **Counterparty Risk**: Charm Finance or its infrastructure providers may fail or be compromised

## 6. Liquidity and Market Structure Risks

### Liquidity Risks
- **Market Illiquidity**: Markets may become illiquid during stress periods
- **Withdrawal Delays**: Large withdrawal requests may experience delays
- **Price Impact**: Large transactions may significantly impact market prices
- **Exit Difficulties**: Users may be unable to exit positions during market stress

### Market Structure Risks
- **MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)**: Miners/validators may extract value from user transactions
- **Front-Running**: Other users may observe and front-run transactions for profit
- **Sandwich Attacks**: Coordinated trading may manipulate transaction execution prices
- **Flash Loan Attacks**: Attackers may use flash loans to exploit protocol vulnerabilities

## 7. Custody and Security Risks

### Self-Custody Risks
- **Private Key Loss**: Loss of private keys results in permanent loss of access
- **Wallet Vulnerabilities**: Wallet software may contain vulnerabilities or be compromised
- **Phishing Attacks**: Users may be tricked into revealing sensitive information
- **Social Engineering**: Attackers may use social engineering to gain access to accounts

### Protocol Security Risks
- **Admin Key Compromise**: If protocol admin keys are compromised, funds may be at risk
- **Multi-Signature Risks**: Multi-signature security may be compromised or unavailable
- **Time-Lock Failures**: Protocol time-locks may not provide adequate security
- **Upgrade Authority**: Protocol upgrade authority may be misused or compromised

## 8. Economic and Incentive Risks

### Token Economics
- **Inflation Risk**: Token supply inflation may dilute holdings
- **Deflation Risk**: Deflationary mechanisms may create unexpected economic effects
- **Incentive Misalignment**: Protocol incentives may not align with user interests
- **Reward Sustainability**: Reward programs may not be sustainable long-term

### Fee Structures
- **Fee Changes**: Protocol fees may change affecting user returns
- **Hidden Costs**: Additional costs may not be clearly disclosed
