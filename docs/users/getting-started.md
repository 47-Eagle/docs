# Getting Started with 47 Eagle Finance

Welcome to 47 Eagle Finance - the omnichain vault platform that lets you earn yield across multiple blockchains seamlessly.

## What is 47 Eagle Finance?

47 Eagle Finance is an omnichain DeFi platform that allows you to:

- **Deposit assets from any supported blockchain**
- **Earn yield through sophisticated dual-token strategies**
- **Withdraw your rewards on any supported network**
- **Access institutional-grade vault strategies**

Think of it as a vault that lives everywhere at once - you can interact with it from any blockchain, but your funds are working together in one unified strategy.

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Connect Your Wallet** - Use any wallet on supported networks
2. **Choose Your Assets** - Deposit WLFI, USD1, or other supported tokens
3. **Select Deposit Network** - Choose which blockchain to deposit from
4. **Earn Yield** - Your assets automatically work in Uniswap V3 strategies
5. **Withdraw Anywhere** - Take your profits on any supported network

## Supported Networks

47 Eagle Finance works across these major blockchains:

- **Ethereum** - The hub chain where the main vault operates
- **Arbitrum** - Low-cost layer 2 for efficient transactions
- **Base** - Coinbase's layer 2 network
- **BSC** - Binance Smart Chain for broader DeFi access
- **Avalanche** - High-performance blockchain network

## Before You Start

### What You'll Need

- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
- Some tokens to deposit (WLFI, USD1, or other supported assets)
- A small amount of native tokens for gas fees on your chosen network

### Understanding the Basics

- **Vault Shares**: When you deposit, you receive shares representing your portion of the vault
